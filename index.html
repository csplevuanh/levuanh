            <p>Have you ever wondered about the true spirit of liberal arts in our modern world, where everything has shifted towards industrialization after the division of labor? I've always sought opportunities to embrace this spirit, whether through scholastic endeavors, lab work, or reading - exposing myself to diverse topics to discover what the Creator has to offer.</p>

            <p>During this quest, I was fortunate to discover in my sophomore year that I wanted to pursue a career as a computational scientist, using the data science pipeline to automate scientific discovery and incorporate scientific evidence into decision-making. I am deeply grateful to <a href="https://sites.google.com/mit.edu/h-wainwrights-group/home">Prof. Haruko M. Wainwright</a> at the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for guiding me in refining these skills through projects on environmental monitoring and revealing the behaviors of underground radioactive waste streams. Additionally, I have collaborated with Vietnam’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment on applying remote sensing technologies to track climate change impacts on hydrological behaviors.</p>

            <p>As I look towards graduate school, I am excited to immerse myself further in computational modeling and simulation and to continue exploring my interests in earth and environmental science, as well as population health, wherever my skills are helpful. On this website, you can find my CV attached on the 2nd page to find more information. Happy exploring!</p>

        <h3>(1) Understand Time-to-MCL Heterogeneity in Groundwater Wells</h3>
        <p>Status: In Progress</p>
        <p>Timeline: May 2024 - Present</p>
        <p>We are investigating the factors that explain the heterogeneity in Time-to-MCL (Maximum Concentration Limits) for groundwater wells. Our goal is to understand why some wells reach MCL faster than others and to identify the key predictors influencing this variability.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gather environmental well data including variables such as aquifer type, screen zone, geographic coordinates, and average concentration in 2024;</li>
            <li>Employ a Random Forest regression to model Time2MCL as a function of the collected predictors;</li>
            <li>Build on prior research utilizing Kalman filters to predict pollutant levels;</li>
            <li>Create informative plots to visualize the trends and forecasted concentrations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>(2) Assessing the Site Closure Time Frame for the Soil and Groundwater Contaminated Sites</h3>
        <p>Status: Completed</p>
        <p>Timeline: Feb 2024 - April 2024</p>
        <p>We're looking at well data from a radioactive waste clean-up site (SRS F-Area) to predict how long it will take for pollution levels to drop to reach regulatory/safe limits (Maximum Concentration Limits - MCLs).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean and preprocess environmental well data from the SRS F-Area;</li>
            <li>Identify trends and predict time-to-MCL using linear regression with uncertainties;</li>
            <li>Use a spatial extrapolation technique to predict the overall cleanup timeline;</li>
            <li>Generate informative plots to visualize concentration trends;</li>
            <li>Plot the wells with decreasing trends on real-time map.</li>
