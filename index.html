            <p>
                <strong>I am looking for Ph.D. opportunities in data science!</strong> I am interested in practical problems in data science, focusing on three directions: data preprocessing, mathematics of data and modelling, and applied data analysis. I currently serve as a Researcher at the Data Science and Applications Lab, Institute of Information Technology, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (supervised by Prof. Nguyen Viet Anh and Prof. Nguyen Truong Thang). I also collaborate with Prof. Paul Liang at MIT EECS‚Äôs Multisensory Intelligence Group. My prior experiences include research internships at Google Research, the University of Tokyo, and Beloit College. Below I present each direction with past work and future plans.
            </p>
            <h3>1. <strong>Data Preprocessing</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Accurate and efficient preprocessing is the key to reliable data insights. No matter how powerful your models are, messy or contaminated inputs could undermine their performance. My work has focused on applying geometric and topological insights, as well as statistics, to enable cleaning, transforming, and extracting stable features from real-world data. In my papers ‚ÄúTopology-Preserving Scaling in Data Augmentation‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Stability of Persistence Diagrams Under Non-Uniform Scaling,‚Äù I analyzed how key topological properties respond to transformations, guiding the design of preprocessing steps that maintain essential invariants. Recently, my accepted paper at ICML 2025 Workshop (DIG-BUGS) about mitigating contaminated data in LLMs addressed automated cleaning in high-volume text input. These projects draw skills from topological data Analysis, theoretical stability bounds, and anomaly detection methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on these experiences, I plan to develop reusable frameworks that add geometric feature extraction and anomaly-detection into standard data pipelines. I will also extend contamination-detection frameworks beyond text to multimodal inputs-all backed by mathematical guarantees. My objective here is to reduce manual effort in data preparation, improve robustness of downstream analytics, and initiate deployment in real-world systems.
            </p>

            <h3>2. <strong>Mathematics of Data and Modelling (Data Dynamics in the Model)</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Understanding how data propagate and transform within models‚Äîand ensuring stability, interpretability, and generalization‚Äîis critical for trustworthy and efficient systems. My research on neural operators, such as ‚ÄúA Mathematical Analysis of Neural Operator Behaviors‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow Analysis Can Teach Us the Optimal Way to Design Neural Operators,‚Äù has provided theoretical guarantees into guiding architectural choices such as basis functions and network depth. My complementary stability analyses from topological also inform how small input perturbations affect learned representations. These results offer a unified perspective on data dynamics inside models. I combine a diverse techniques including functional analysis, approximation theory,  representation dynamics, and the enforcement of domain constraints (e.g., PDE structures) to build surrogate models with rigorous underpinnings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, I will look into learning representation dynamics in neural networks more deeply, such as quantifying how small changes in input propagate through layers or operator modules. I intend to develop physics-informed surrogate models that respect real-world physics‚Äîfor example, in climate or fluid dynamics‚Äîtrained on limited data but equipped with provable error bounds. Another avenue is to design lightweight architectures for edge or resource-constrained deployments such as robotics or offline environment.
            </p>

            <h3>3. <strong>Applied Data Analysis</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Translating theoretical advances and efficient preprocessing into applications ensures real-world impact. In environmental analytics, my work on land subsidence monitoring in Ho Chi Minh City has helped inform policy and risk management in urban planning. In NLP pipelines, I have evaluated how contamination mitigation methods improve downstream model performance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving forward, I aim to continue developing hybrid data‚Äìphysics models for climate and natural-hazard forecasting, so we may address our pressing environmental challenges. In industrial and IoT contexts, I will prototype edge-deployable systems that perform real-time preprocessing, anomaly detection, and predictive inference for optimizing operations and costs. By these collaborative projects with environmental agencies, industry stakeholders, or NGOs, I seek to demonstrate how data-driven solutions can reduce manual effort and enhance decision-making.
            </p>
